# Code Style

- No inline if statements. Always use block form with braces/indentation.
- Prefer early returns over if/else chains. Override the variable or return early instead of nesting else blocks.
- No comments unless absolutely necessary. Write readable, self-documenting code.
- No emojis in code, commits, PRs, or responses.
- No unnecessary type annotations or docstrings. Only add them when they provide genuine clarity.
- Prefer simple over clever. Avoid ternaries, one-liners, or compact expressions when a straightforward version reads better.
- No affirmations in responses. Be direct and concise.
